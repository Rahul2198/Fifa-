# FOOTBALL PLAYERS OVERALL PREDICTOR WITH EDA 
## Resources
Link to the Dataset - https://www.kaggle.com/karangadiya/fifa19


Tasks included cleaning of the given dataset , performing EDA and predicting the overall of players

## Motivation
People in general, do not pay attention to the specific attributes of a player. All they care about is the overall performance of the player. Here, I have created a Model , which predicts the overall of a player given his seperate individual attributes.


## Techonolgies Used 
This project uses Numpy 1.18.3, Pandas 1.0.4,  Scikit_Learn 0.23.1.

## Environment 
The Data Cleaning, EDA, Model Building were run in a Jupyter Notebook environment.

## Models Used
Random Forest model is used as of now(Subject to changes)
